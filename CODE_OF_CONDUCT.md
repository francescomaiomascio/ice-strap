# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the context of **ICE Strap**, participation refers to discussion,
review, critique, and improvement of **bootstrap, packaging, and
enablement** material.

We, as maintainers and participants, pledge to keep all interactions
professional, respectful, and focused on the **operational integrity**
of the repository.

ICE Strap is a **bootstrap and enablement repository**.
It exists to make ICE projects **buildable, runnable, and inspectable**
under upstream constraints — not to redefine those constraints.

Participation is expected to reflect this purpose.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to a constructive environment include:

- Maintaining a professional and technically rigorous tone
- Engaging in good-faith discussion of changes, not individuals
- Respecting repository scope and upstream authority boundaries
- Prioritizing reproducibility, clarity, and determinism
- Accepting correction when proposals introduce implicit semantics or drift

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Personal attacks, insults, or derogatory remarks
- Trolling, bad-faith argumentation, or deliberate derailment
- Repeatedly pushing changes that introduce **new semantics** or violate scope
- Introducing ideological, political, or personal agendas
- Harassment, intimidation, or hostile behavior in any form

ICE Strap is not a product feature forum.
It is an **enablement layer** constrained by upstream authority.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for:

- Preserving the operational integrity of the repository
- Moderating discussions that violate this Code of Conduct
- Removing or closing content that is disruptive, abusive, or off-scope

Moderation decisions are based on **alignment with repository purpose**
and upstream constraints, not on consensus or popularity.

## Attribution

bootstrap nature** of the ICE Strap repository.
