# ICE Strap
## Bootstrap and System Provisioning Layer of the ICE Ecosystem

ICE Strap defines the **bootstrap and provisioning layer**
of the ICE ecosystem.

It is responsible for **bringing ICE systems into existence**
in a controlled, repeatable, and inspectable way,
before any runtime execution, intelligence, or interaction occurs.

ICE Strap does not execute workloads.
It does not decide behavior.
It does not remain active during normal system operation.

It exists to **start ICE correctly — and then step aside**.

---

## Position in the ICE Ecosystem

ICE Strap operates at the **earliest lifecycle boundary**.

- Conceptual authority is defined by **ICE Foundation**
- Execution begins only after **ICE Runtime / Engine** are active
- Intelligence and cognition are provided by **ICE AI** and **ICE Consciousness**

ICE Strap precedes execution.
It does not participate in it.

---

## Purpose

ICE Strap exists to:

- bootstrap ICE systems deterministically
- provision initial system structure and configuration
- establish initial authority boundaries
- prepare environments for Runtime and Engine
- ensure reproducible system startup
- support local, distributed, and automated deployments

ICE Strap answers a single question:

> How does an ICE system come into existence **correctly**?

---

## What ICE Strap Is

ICE Strap is:

- a **bootstrap mechanism**
- a **provisioning and initialization layer**
- a **controlled system entry point**
- a **reproducibility and setup authority**

It ensures that ICE systems start
in a known, valid, and governable state.

---

## What ICE Strap Is Not

ICE Strap is **not**:

- a runtime
- an orchestrator
- a workflow engine
- an intelligence layer
- a configuration management system
- a long-running process

Once ICE is running,
ICE Strap is no longer involved.

---

## Scope

ICE Strap may include:

- environment and workspace initialization
- initial directory and filesystem layout
- baseline configuration materialization
- initial identity and trust bootstrapping
- runtime and engine handoff logic
- local and distributed startup flows
- developer and CI-friendly entrypoints

All actions performed by ICE Strap are:

- explicit
- deterministic
- inspectable
- traceable

---

## Authority and Governance

ICE Strap does **not** grant ongoing authority.

- It may establish initial authority structures
- It may validate preconditions
- It may refuse to start an invalid system

It may **not**:

- authorize execution
- bypass governance
- alter system behavior after startup

All authority exercised by ICE Strap
is transitional and auditable.

---

## Stability and Evolution

ICE Strap is expected to be:

- small
- conservative
- slow-changing

Bootstrap logic must be more stable
than downstream systems.

Changes to ICE Strap are rare
and treated as high-impact.

---

## Usage

ICE Strap is invoked:

- during local development setup
- during CI/CD provisioning
- during deployment and initialization
- during controlled system resets

It hands control to:

- ICE Runtime
- ICE Engine
- orchestration layers

After handoff, ICE Strap is inactive.

---

## Canonical Status

ICE Strap is **structurally required**,
but **not authoritative** beyond bootstrap.

If ICE Strap is incorrect,
ICE cannot start safely.

If ICE Strap is removed after startup,
ICE remains valid.

---

## Status

ICE Strap is under **active development**.

Its scope is intentionally narrow
and will remain so.

---

## Notes

Most system failures
are born at startup.

ICE Strap exists to ensure
**failure never starts silently**.
